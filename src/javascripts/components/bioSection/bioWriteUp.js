    .html(`<div><p1>After working in multiple facets of I.T. for almost twenty years, I have decided to shift beyond being a “supporter of creators” to become a creator myself. For these nearly two decades, I have stood in awe of what development teams are able to accomplish when they have business goals coupled with a desire to improve people’s lives through the products they create.
  I have supported products and provided troubleshooting (help desk), gathered and documented how systems were intended to work before and as they were built (business analysis), coached and guided teams to use better practices through self observation and incremental improvement (scrum master), and coached other scrum masters to help their teams grow and perform at their best given their unique needs and challenges (agile coach). All of these experiences and perspectives have prepared me to take the plunge into building amazing products that will ultimately improve lives. I embrace the never ending journey of learning that is software engineering.</p1>

  <p2>Dynamic, hands-on Agile Coach and Scrum Master who has become so fascinated with how applications are built that I decided to learn how to build them myself. I decided to not only teach people how to build things in an agile way, but to walk the walk and build amazing things myself with agility at the core.

  <br>
  I have experience managing large enterprise software development projects that meet demanding time restraints and exceed expectations. Demonstrated ability to motivate, organize, lead and coach Scrum teams across multiple locations, with a verifiable track record of managing complex projects while delivering on time, under budget and above expectations. Ability to manage many projects at once while working within strict deadlines and maintaining professionalism. Skilled in providing effective leadership in fast-paced, deadline-driven environments, with outstanding oral and written presentation and communication skills. Promoted to positions of increasing authority and responsibility because of strong leadership skills, teamwork, customer service and overall performance. Excel at turning individuals into teams that work efficiently and exceed expectations.</p2></div>`);
